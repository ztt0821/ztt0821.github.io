            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in Prof. Qi Dou's group at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, specializing in large models for medical imaging. My research primarily focuses on prostate MRI image segmentation and gastrointestinal endoscopy image processing, utilizing multimodal large models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of image analysis in these areas.</p>
            <p>Prior to my postdoctoral work, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Kam-Yiu Lam and Prof. Chi-Yin Chow. During my Ph.D., I collaborated with Prof. Yuan-Yi Zheng of Shanghai Sixth People’s Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and Prof. Xiao-Jun Chen of Shanghai Jiao Tong University on ultrasound image detection and segmentation projects. I also worked with Prof. Ao Li of Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital on a median nerve data collection project.</p>
            <p>My research interests include medical image analysis (e.g., detection, segmentation, denoising, etc.), generative models, and 3D vision (e.g., 3D image analysis).</p>

            <h2>Datasets</h2>
            <p>The ultrasound median nerve dataset was collected by recruiting 80 volunteers with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Using a GE Logiq E9 ultrasound machine and a linear probe, the nerves of volunteers were scanned at sampling points from the proximal to the distal wrist. Approximately 10 seconds of video was collected from each volunteer. This dataset can be used for tasks such as tracking, classification, detection, and segmentation.</p>
